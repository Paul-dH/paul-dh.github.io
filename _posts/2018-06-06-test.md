## Rambling

One of my favorite things about events like the [PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit](https://powershell.org/summit/) is the opportunity to chat with so many folks in the PowerShell community.  Invariably, you end up bringing back a wealth of [fun ideas](http://ramblingcookiemonster.github.io/RabbitMQ-Intro/).

This year, [Brandon Olin](https://twitter.com/devblackops) gave an awesome lightning demo on [PoshBot](https://github.com/poshbotio/PoshBot), a PowerShell-based bot framework.  It's not quite as mature as [Errbot](https://hodgkins.io/chatops-with-powershell-and-errbot) or [Hubot](https://hodgkins.io/chatops-on-windows-with-hubot-and-powershell), but it's a super quick way to get a bot up and running for folks using PowerShell!

## Why ChatOps? Why Bots?

I'll let someone more well versed in the topic handle this - Jason Hand has a great [beginners guide to ChatOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8Vfoz7GeHw).  Long story short?
